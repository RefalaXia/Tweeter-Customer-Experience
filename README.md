### Description
Graduate Hotels is a hand-crafted collection of hotels located in college towns across the country, launched in 2014 by Nashville-based real estate company Adventurous Journeys Capital Partners. The unique positioning of Graduate Hotels is one of their strengths. Might it also be a weakness? We would like to perform an analysis based on Twitter for the Graduate Hotels. This analysis is addressed to the executive management of Graduate Hotels, the primary stakeholders.

### Question
We know that reviews are influential in deciding whether people stay at hotels. Many people trust customer reviews and are influenced to stay or choose a different hotel because of them. We also need to keep in mind that, though these reviews are influential, they are not necessarily indicative of fact or truth. There is likely to be a sampling bias of people who choose to answer reviews - those who had a good experience and those with negative ones. Issues highlighted by these reviews may indicate ways to improve service but may not be representative of major issues. Considering the millions of visitors over the years, reviews are posted by a tiny percentage of people. A good idea would be to incentivize or encourage reviews, perhaps with check-out souvenirs like a card with candy with a QR code to add a review. This may encourage a better and more positive depiction of the "truth" in reviews.

Considering all this and the available data, our question is: what are the strengths and weaknesses of Graduate Hotels, and how do different branches compare? This can help define insights such as what procedures different branches can adopt.
